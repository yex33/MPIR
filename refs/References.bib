	abstract = {This paper presents a documentation and development method to facilitate the certification of scientific computing software used in the safety analysis of nuclear facilities. To study the problems faced during quality assurance and certification activities, a case study was performed on legacy software used for thermal analysis of a fuelpin in a nuclear reactor. Although no errors were uncovered in the code, 27 issues of incompleteness and inconsistency were found with the documentation. This work proposes that software documentation follow a rational process, which includes a software requirements specification following a template that is reusable, maintainable, and understandable. To develop the design and implementation, this paper suggests literate programming as an alternative to traditional structured programming. Literate programming allows for documenting of numerical algorithms and code together in what is termed the literate programmer's manual. This manual is developed with explicit traceability to the software requirements specification. The traceability between the theory, numerical algorithms, and implementation facilitates achieving completeness and consistency, as well as simplifies the process of verification and the associated certification.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01850},
	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2011.01850},
	abstract = {The {GMRES} method is used to solve sparse, non-symmetric systems of linear equations arising from many scientific applications. The solver performance within a single node is memory bound, due to the low arithmetic intensity of its computational kernels. To reduce the amount of data movement, and thus, to improve performance, we investigated the effect of using a mix of single and double precision while retaining double-precision accuracy. Previous efforts have explored reduced precision in the preconditioner, but the use of reduced precision in the solver itself has received limited attention. We found that {GMRES} only needs double precision in computing the residual and updating the approximate solution to achieve double-precision accuracy, although it must restart after each improvement of single-precision accuracy. This finding holds for the tested orthogonalization schemes: Modified Gram-Schmidt ({MGS}) and Classical Gram-Schmidt with Re-orthogonalization ({CGSR}). Furthermore, our mixed-precision {GMRES}, when restarted at least once, performed 19\% and 24\% faster on average than double-precision {GMRES} for {MGS} and {CGSR}, respectively. Our implementation uses generic programming techniques to ease the burden of coding implementations for different data types. Our use of the Kokkos library allowed us to exploit parallelism and optimize data management. Additionally, {KokkosKernels} was used when producing performance results. In conclusion, using a mix of single and double precision in {GMRES} can improve performance while retaining double-precision accuracy.},

On the other hand, effective preconditioning strategies are often designed where the preconditioner varies from one step to the next so that a flexible Krylov solver is required. In this paper, we present a new numerical technique for nonsymmetric problems that combines these two features. We illustrate the numerical behavior of the new solver both on a set of small academic test examples as well as on large industrial simulation arising in wave propagation simulations.},
