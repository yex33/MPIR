\subsection{Mathematical Notation}

\plt{This section is optional, but should be included for projects that make use
  of notation to convey mathematical information.  For instance, if typographic
  conventions (like bold face font) are used to distinguish matrices, this
  should be stated here.  If symbols are used to show mathematical operations,
  these should be summarized here.  In some cases the easiest way to summarize
  the notation is to point to a text or other source that explains the
  notation.}

\plt{This section was added to the template because some students use very
  domain specific notation.  This notation will not be readily understandable to

\plt{The SRS is not generally written, or read, sequentially.  The SRS is a
  reference document.  It is generally read in an ad hoc order, as the need
  arises.  For writing an SRS, and for reading one for the first time, the
  suggested order of sections is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal Statement
\item Instance Models
\item Requirements
\item Introduction
\item Specific System Description
\end{itemize}
}

\plt{Guiding principles for the SRS document:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not repeat the same information at the same abstraction level.  If
  information is repeated, the repetition should be at a different abstraction
  level.  For instance, there will be overlap between the scope section and the
  assumptions, but the scope section will not go into as much detail as the
  assumptions section.

\plt{The template description comments should be disabled before submitting this
  document for grading.}

\plt{You can borrow any wording from the text given in the template.  It is part
  of the template, and not considered an instance of academic integrity.  Of
  course, you need to cite the source of the template.}

\plt{When the documentation is done, it should be possible to trace back to the
  source of every piece of information.  Some information will come from
  external sources, like terminology.  Other information will be derived, like
  General Definitions.}

\plt{An SRS document should have the following qualities: unambiguous,
  consistent, complete, validatable, abstract and traceable.}

\plt{The overall goal of the SRS is that someone that meets the Characteristics
  of the Intended Reader (Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}) can learn,
  understand and verify the captured domain knowledge.  They should not have to
  trust the authors of the SRS on any statements.  They should be able to
  independently verify/derive every statement made.}

\section{Introduction}

Solving linear systems is a key part of numerical computing and is widely used
in many applications, creating a demand for fast and reliable solvers. Modern
hardware and software have shown that using lower-precision calculations can be
much faster and more memory-efficient than traditional double-precision (64-bit)
methods. Mixed-precision (MP) algorithms combine the speed of lower-precision
calculations with the accuracy of higher-precision ones to improve performance
in various linear solvers. The document describes the solver called \progname,
which implements an iterative method in mixed-precisions and uses GMRES in
particular for find the error correction vector during the refinement process.

The following section provides an overview of the Software Requirements
Specification (SRS) for \progname. This section explains the purpose of this
document, the scope of the requirements, the characteristics of the intended
reader, and the organization of the document.

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

\plt{This section summarizes the purpose of the SRS document.  It does not focus
  on the problem itself.  The problem is described in the ``Problem
  Description'' section (Section~\ref{Sec_pd}).  The purpose is for the document
  in the context of the project itself, not in the context of this course.
  Although the ``purpose'' of the document is to get a grade, you should not
  mention this.  Instead, ``fake it'' as if this is a real project.  The purpose
  section will be similar between projects.  The purpose of the document is the
  purpose of the SRS, including communication, planning for the design stage,
  etc.}

The primary purpose of this document is to record the requirements of \progname.
Goals, assumptions, theoretical models, definitions, and other model derivation
information are specified, allowing the reader to fully understand and verify
the purpose and scientific basis of \progname.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements}

\plt{Modelling the real world requires simplification.  The full complexity of
  the actual physics, chemistry, biology is too much for existing models, and
  for existing computational solution techniques.  Rather than say what is in
  the scope, it is usually easier to say what is not.  You can think of it as
  the scope is initially everything, and then it is constrained to create the
  actual scope.  For instance, the problem can be restricted to 2 dimensions, or
  it can ignore the effect of temperature (or pressure) on the material
  properties, etc.}

\plt{The scope section is related to the assumptions section
  (Section~\ref{sec_assumpt}).  However, the scope and the assumptions are not
  at the same level of abstraction.  The scope is at a high level.  The focus is
  on the ``big picture'' assumptions.  The assumptions section lists, and
  describes, all of the assumptions.}

\plt{The scope section is relevant for later determining typical values of inputs. The scope should make it clear what inputs are reasonable to expect. This is a distinction between scope and context (context is a later section).  Scope affects the inputs while context affects how the software will be used.}

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}

\plt{This section summarizes the skills and knowledge of the readers of the
  SRS.  It does NOT have the same purpose as the ``User Characteristics''
  section (Section~\ref{SecUserCharacteristics}).  The intended readers are the
  people that will read, review and maintain the SRS.  They are the people that
  will conceivably design the software that is intended to meet the
  requirements.  The user, on the other hand, is the person that uses the
  software that is built.  They may never read this SRS document.  Of course,
  the same person could be a ``user'' and an ``intended reader.''}

\plt{The intended reader characteristics should be written as unambiguously and
  as specifically as possible.  Rather than say, the user should have an
  understanding of physics, say what kind of physics and at what level.  For
  instance, is high school physics adequate, or should the reader have had a
  graduate course on advanced quantum mechanics?}

\subsection{Organization of Document}

\plt{This section provides a roadmap of the SRS document.  It will help the
  reader orient themselves.  It will provide direction that will help them
  select which sections they want to read, and in what order.  This section will
  be similar between project.}

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.

\plt{The purpose of this section is to provide general information about the
  system so the specific requirements in the next section will be easier to
  understand. The general system description section is designed to be
  changeable independent of changes to the functional requirements documented in
  the specific system description. The general system description provides a
  context for a family of related models.  The general description can stay the
  same, while specific details are changed between family members.}

\subsection{System Context}

\plt{Your system context will include a figure that shows the abstract view of
  the software.  Often in a scientific context, the program can be viewed
  abstractly following the design pattern of Inputs $\rightarrow$ Calculations
  $\rightarrow$ Outputs.  The system context will therefore often follow this
  pattern.  The user provides inputs, the system does the calculations, and then
  provides the outputs to the user.  The figure should not show all of the
  inputs, just an abstract view of the main categories of inputs (like material
  properties, geometry, etc.).  Likewise, the outputs should be presented from
  an abstract point of view.  In some cases the diagram will show other external
  entities, besides the user.  For instance, when the software product is a
  library, the user will be another software program, not an actual end user.
  If there are system constraints that the software must work with external
  libraries, these libraries can also be shown on the System Context diagram.
  They should only be named with a specific library name if this is required by
  the system constraint.}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{SystemContextFigure}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig_SystemContext}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\plt{For each of the entities in the system context diagram its responsibilities
  should be listed.  Whenever possible the system should check for data quality,
  but for some cases the user will need to assume that responsibility.  The list
  of responsibilities should be about the inputs and outputs only, and they
  should be abstract.  Details should not be presented here.  However, the
  information should not be so abstract as to just say ``inputs'' and
  ``outputs''.  A summarizing phrase can be used to characterize the inputs.
  For instance, saying ``material properties'' provides some information, but it
  stays away from the detail of listing every required properties.}

\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item
\end{itemize}
\item \progname{} Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters instead of a
  floating point number
\item
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\plt{Identify in what context the software will typically be used.  Is it for
exploration? education? engineering work? scientific work?. Identify whether it
will be used for mission-critical or safety-critical applications.} \plt{This
additional context information is needed to determine how much effort should be
devoted to the rationale section.  If the application is safety-critical, the
bar is higher.  This is currently less structured, but analogous to, the idea to
the Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs) that McSCert uses in their
automotive hazard analyses.}

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

\plt{This section summarizes the knowledge/skills expected of the user.
  Measuring usability, which is often a required non-function requirement,
  requires knowledge of a typical user.  As mentioned above, the user is a
  different role from the ``intended reader,'' as given in
  Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}.  As in Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}, the
  user characteristics should be specific an unambiguous.  For instance, ``The
  end user of \progname{} should have an understanding of undergraduate Level 1
  Calculus and Physics.''}

\subsection{System Constraints}

\plt{System constraints differ from other type of requirements because they
  limit the developers' options in the system design and they identify how the
  eventual system must fit into the world. This is the only place in the SRS
  where design decisions can be specified.  That is, the quality requirement for
  abstraction is relaxed here.  However, system constraints should only be
  included if they are truly required.}

\section{Specific System Description}

This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level
view of the problem to be solved.  This is followed by the solution characteristics
specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, definitions and finally
the instance models.  \plt{Add any project specific details that are relevant
  for the section overview.}

\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}

\progname{} is a solver intended to find a numerical solution \(\vec{x}\) to a sparse
linear system characterized in the equation \(\matr{A}\vec{x} = \vec{b}\), where
\(\matr{A}\) is an \(n \times n\) matrix and \(\vec{b}\) is an \(n\) vector.

\subsubsection{Terminology and  Definitions}

\plt{This section is expressed in words, not with equations.  It provide the
  meaning of the different words and phrases used in the domain of the problem.
The terminology is used to introduce concepts from the world outside of the
mathematical model  The terminology provides a real world connection to give the
mathematical model meaning.}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it
easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\begin{itemize}

\item

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Physical System Description} \label{sec_phySystDescrip}

Not applicable to this project because it does not interact with any physical
system.

\subsubsection{Goal Statements}

\noindent Given an \(n \times n\) matrix \(\matr{A}\) and an \(n\) vector \(\vec{b}\),
where \(n\) is the size of the matrix, the goal statement is:

\begin{itemize}
\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{GS:Axb}:] find a numerical
  solution \(\vec{x}\) to the linear system characterized in the equation
  \(\matr{A}\vec{x} = \vec{b}\).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}

This section specifies the information in the solution domain of \progname. This
section is intended to express what is required in such a way that analysts and
stakeholders get a clear picture, and the latter will accept it. The purpose of
this section is to reduce the problem into one expressed in mathematical terms.

This section presents the solution characteristics by successively refining
models. It starts with the abstract/general Theoretical Models (TMs) and refines
them to the concrete/specific Instance Models (IMs). The instance models that
govern \progname are presented in Subsection~\ref{sec_instance}. The
information to understand the meaning of the instance models and their
derivation is also presented, so that the instance models can be verified.

\subsubsection{Types}

\plt{This section is optional. Defining types can make the document easier to
understand.}

\subsubsection{Scope Decisions}

The scope of this project is inherently limited due to the need to build upon
the previous research work rather than formulating a completely new approach to
the problem described in Subsection \ref{Sec_pd}. A signification portion of this
project is dedicated to refactor the prior work, ensuring consistency with its
methodology and results before introducing any new contributions. This project
must loosely adhere to the same assumptions established in the original study to
maintain comparability and validity, as altering these assumptions would
fundamentally change the research direction.

\subsubsection{Modelling Decisions}

\plt{This section is optional.}

\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}

\plt{The assumptions are a refinement of the scope.  The scope is general, where
  the assumptions are specific.  All assumptions should be listed, even those
  that domain experts know so well that they are rarely (if ever) written down.}
\plt{The document should not take for granted that the reader knows which
  assumptions have been made. In the case of unusual assumptions, it is
  recommended that the documentation either include, or point to, an explanation
  and justification for the assumption.}
\plt{If it helps with the organization and understandability, the assumptions
can be presented as sub sections.  The following sub-sections are options:
background theory assumptions, helper theory assumptions, generic theory
assumptions, problem specific assumptions, and rationale assumptions}

This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the
theoretical model by filling in the missing information for the physical system.
The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the theoretical model [TM],
general definition [GD], data definition [DD], instance model [IM], or likely
change [LC], in which the respective assumption is used.

\begin{itemize}
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A:quasi}:] The input matrix
  \(\matr{A}\) is symmetric quasi-definite. (Definitions of symmetric matrices
  and quasi-definite matrices are given in \ddref{DD:sym} and
  \ddref{DD:quasidef}, respectively.)
\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A:prec}:] The given
  precisions follow the order \(u_f \leq u_w \leq u_r\), with \(u_r\) being the
  highest precision.

  \plt{Short description of each assumption. Each assumption
    should have a meaningful label. Use cross-references to identify the
    appropriate traceability to TM, GD, DD etc., using commands like dref, ddref
    etc. Each assumption should be atomic - that is, there should not be an
    explicit (or implicit) ``and'' in the text of an assumption.}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Models}\label{sec_theoretical}

\plt{Theoretical models are sets of abstract mathematical equations or axioms
  for solving the problem described in Section ``Physical System Description''
  (Section~\ref{sec_phySystDescrip}). Examples of theoretical models are
  physical laws, constitutive equations, relevant conversion factors, etc.}

\plt{Optionally the theory section could be divided into subsections to provide
more structure and improve understandability and reusability.  Potential
subsections include the following: Context theories, background theories, helper
theories, generic theories, problem specific theories, final theories and
rationale theories.}

This section focuses on the general equations and laws that \progname{} is based
on.  \plt{Modify the examples below for your problem, and add additional models
  as appropriate.}

  causing closely placed vectors to move far apart. This makes it difficult for
  iterative solvers to ``backtrack'' what happened before and after the
  transformation. By preconditioning \(\matr{A}\) with an approximate inverse,
  we are effectively ``undoing'' some (but not all) of the transformations,
  taming \(\matr{A}\) down to some extent. And then we can work with a tamed
  down, better conditioned version of \(\matr{A}\) and solve the system from
  there. }

{ Iterative refinement is a process for reducing the round-off error in the
  computed solution \(\vec{x}_0\) to an \(n \times n\) system of linear
  equations \(\matr{A}\vec{x} = \vec{b}\). Any appropriate method with
  reasonable accuracy can be used at step \ref{algo:ir:solve}. Only step
  \ref{algo:ir:residual} requires higher precision. Under the assumption
  \aref{A:prec} on given arithmetic precision configurations, that the precision
  used for computing the residual would be the highest, the final result
  produced by the result is shown to be accurate. }

\plt{``Ref.\ By'' is used repeatedly with the different types of information.
  This stands for Referenced By.  It means that the models, definitions and
  assumptions listed reference the current model, definition or assumption
  This information is given for traceability.  Ref. By provides a pointer in the
  opposite direction to what we commonly do.  You still need to have a reference
  in the other direction pointing to the current model, definition or
  assumption.  As an example, if TM1 is referenced by GD2, that means that GD2 will
  explicitly include a reference to TM1.}

\subsubsection{General Definitions}\label{sec_gendef}

\plt{General Definitions (GDs) are a refinement of one or more TMs, and/or of
  other GDs.  The GDs are less abstract than the TMs.  Generally the reduction
  in abstraction is possible through invoking (using/referencing) Assumptions.
  For instance, the TM could be Newton's Law of Cooling stated abstracting.  The
  GD could take the general law and apply it to get a 1D equation.}

This section collects the laws and equations that will be used in building the
instance models.

\subsubsection{Instance Models} \label{sec_instance}

\plt{The motivation for this section is to reduce the problem defined in
  ``Physical System Description'' (Section~\ref{sec_phySystDescrip}) to one
  expressed in mathematical terms. The IMs are built by refining the TMs and/or
  GDs.  This section should remain abstract.  The SRS should specify the
  requirements without considering the implementation.}

This section transforms the problem defined in Section~\ref{Sec_pd} into
one which is expressed in mathematical terms. It uses concrete symbols defined
in Section~\ref{sec_datadef} to replace the abstract symbols in the models
identified in Sections~\ref{sec_theoretical} and~\ref{sec_gendef}.

The goal \gsref{GS:Axb} is solved by \iref{IM}.

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints}

Table~\ref{TblInputVar} shows the data constraints on the input output
variables.  The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations
on the range of values that can be taken by the variable.  The column for
software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.  The
software constraints will be helpful in the design stage for picking suitable
algorithms.  The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.  The column of typical values
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.  The uncertainty column
provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be
measured.  This information would be part of the input if one were performing an
uncertainty quantification exercise.

The specification parameters in Table~\ref{TblInputVar} are listed in
Table~\ref{TblSpecParams}.

  validation.  Those topics will be addressed in the Verification and Validation
  plan.}

\section{Requirements}

\plt{The requirements refine the goal statement.  They will make heavy use of
  references to the instance models.}

This section provides the functional requirements, the business tasks that the
software is expected to complete, and the nonfunctional requirements, the
qualities that the software is expected to exhibit.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Inputs}:] \plt{Requirements
    for the inputs that are supplied by the user.  This information has to be
    explicit.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_OutputInputs}:] \plt{It isn't
    always required, but often echoing the inputs as part of the output is a
    good idea.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Calculate}:] \plt{Calculation
    related requirements.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_VerifyOutput}:]
  \plt{Verification related requirements.}

\item[R\refstepcounter{reqnum}\thereqnum \label{R_Output}:] \plt{Output related
    requirements.}

\end{itemize}

\plt{Every IM should map to at least one requirement, but not every requirement
  has to map to a corresponding IM.}

\subsection{Nonfunctional Requirements}

\plt{List your nonfunctional requirements.  You may consider using a fit
  criterion to make them verifiable.}
\plt{The goal is for the nonfunctional requirements to be unambiguous, abstract
  and verifiable.  This isn't easy to show succinctly, so a good strategy may be
to give a ``high level'' view of the requirement, but allow for the details to
be covered in the Verification and Validation document.}
\plt{An absolute requirement on a quality of the system is rarely needed.  For
  instance, an accuracy of 0.0101 \% is likely fine, even if the requirement is
  for 0.01 \% accuracy.  Therefore, the emphasis will often be more on
  describing now well the quality is achieved, through experimentation, and
  possibly theory, rather than meeting some bar that was defined a priori.}
\plt{You do not need an entry for correctness in your NFRs.  The purpose of the
  SRS is to record the requirements that need to be satisfied for correctness.
  Any statement of correctness would just be redundant. Rather than discuss
  correctness, you can characterize how far away from the correct (true)
  solution you are allowed to be.  This is discussed under accuracy.}

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Accuracy}:]
  \textbf{Accuracy} \plt{Characterize the accuracy by giving the context/use for
    the software.  Maybe something like, ``The accuracy of the computed
    solutions should meet the level needed for $<$engineering or scientific
    application$>$.  The level of accuracy achieved by \progname{} shall be
    described following the procedure given in Section~X of the Verification and
    Validation Plan.''  A link to the VnV plan would be a nice extra.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Usability}:] \textbf{Usability}
  \plt{Characterize the usability by giving the context/use for the software.
    You should likely reference the user characteristics section.  The level of
    usability achieved by the software shall be described following the
    procedure given in Section~X of the Verification and Validation Plan.  A
    link to the VnV plan would be a nice extra.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Maintainability}:]
  \textbf{Maintainability} \plt{The effort required to make any of the likely
    changes listed for \progname{} should be less than FRACTION of the original
    development time.  FRACTION is then a symbolic constant that can be defined
    at the end of the report.}

\item[NFR\refstepcounter{nfrnum}\thenfrnum \label{NFR_Portability}:]
  \textbf{Portability} \plt{This NFR is easier to write than the others.  The
    systems that \progname{} should run on should be listed here.  When possible
    the specific versions of the potential operating environments should be
    given.  To make the NFR verifiable a statement could be made that the tests
    from a given section of the VnV plan can be successfully run on all of the
    possible operating environments.}

\item Other NFRs that might be discussed include verifiability,
  understandability and reusability.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rationale}

\plt{Provide a rationale for the decisions made in the documentation.  Rationale
should be provided for scope decisions, modelling decisions, assumptions and
typical values.}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

\plt{You will have to modify these tables for your problem.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is not generally symmetric.  If GD1 uses A1, that
  means that GD1's derivation or presentation requires invocation of A1.  A1
  does not use GD1.  A1 is ``used by'' GD1.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is challenging to maintain manually.  Please do
  your best.  In the future tools (like Drasil) will make this much easier.}

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
changed. Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.

\section{Development Plan}

\plt{This section is optional.  It is used to explain the plan for developing
  the software.  In particular, this section gives a list of the order in which
  the requirements will be implemented.  In the context of a course  this is
  where you can indicate which requirements will be implemented as part of the
  course, and which will be ``faked'' as future work.  This section can be
  organized as a prioritized list of requirements, or it could should the
  requirements that will be implemented for ``phase 1'', ``phase 2'', etc.}

\section{Values of Auxiliary Constants}

\plt{Show the values of the symbolic parameters introduced in the report.}

\plt{The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.}

\plt{The value of FRACTION, for the Maintainability NFR would be given here.}

\noindent \plt{Grammar, flow and \LaTeX advice:
\begin{itemize}
\item For Mac users \texttt{*.DS\_Store} should be in \texttt{.gitignore}
\item \LaTeX{} and formatting rules
\begin{itemize}
\item Variables are italic, everything else not, includes subscripts (link to
  document)
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/typefaces.pdf}{Conventions}
\item Watch out for implied multiplication
\end{itemize}
\item Use BibTeX
\item Use cross-referencing
\end{itemize}
\item Grammar and writing rules
\begin{itemize}
\item Acronyms expanded on first usage (not just in table of acronyms)
\item ``In order to'' should be ``to''
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}}

\noindent \plt{Advice on using the template:
\begin{itemize}
\item Difference between physical and software constraints
\item Properties of a correct solution means \emph{additional} properties, not
  a restating of the requirements (may be ``not applicable'' for your problem).
  If you have a table of output constraints, then these are properties of a
  correct solution.
\item Assumptions have to be invoked somewhere
\item ``Referenced by'' implies that there is an explicit reference
\item Think of traceability matrix, list of assumption invocations and list of
  reference by fields as automatically generatable
\item If you say the format of the output (plot, table etc), then your
  requirement could be more abstract
\end{itemize}
