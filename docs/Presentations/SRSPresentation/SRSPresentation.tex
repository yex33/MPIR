\frametitle{Think Big, Think Sparse}

\begin{itemize}
\item In structural simulations (e.g., finite element analysis), structures are
  modeled based on real-world physics, where forces and constraints are often
  localized.
\item Each element or node in a structure is typically connected only to a few
  nearby elements or nodes.
\item System of equations in structural simulations is assembled from local
  contributions.
\item In contrast, in neural networks, dense weight matrices are used in fully
  connected layers.

\frametitle{Iterative Refinement}

\begin{itemize}
\item A method to enhance the accuracy of a solution to \(\matr{A}\vec{x} = \vec{b}\)
\end{itemize}

The algorithm goes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Solve \(\matr{A}\vec{x}_0 = \vec{b}\) \emph{approximately} to get an initial solution \(\vec{x}_0\).
\item Compute the residual \(\vec{r} = \vec{b} - \matr{A}\vec{x}_0\), which measures how far \(\vec{x}_0\) is
  from being an exact solution.
\item Solve \(\matr{A}\vec{e} = \vec{r}\) for the correction vector \(\vec{e}\).
\item Update (``refine'') the solution as \(\vec{x}_1 = \vec{x}_0 + \vec{e}\).
\item Repeat steps 2--4 until the residual \(\vec{r}\) is small enough.
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Iterative Refinement in Mixed-Precision}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Solve \(\matr{A}\vec{x}_0 = \vec{b}\) \emph{approximately} in \textbf{low} precision.
\item Compute the residual \(\vec{r} = \vec{b} - \matr{A}\vec{x}_0\) in \textbf{high} precision.
\item Solve \(\matr{A}\vec{e} = \vec{r}\) for the correction vector \(\vec{e}\) in \textbf{low} precision.
\item Update the solution as \(\vec{x}_1 = \vec{x}_0 + \vec{e}\) in \textbf{medium} precision.
\item Repeat steps 2--4 until the residual \(\vec{r}\) is small enough.
\end{enumerate}

Key points:

\begin{itemize}
\item Trade computational complexity for space complexity
\item Preserve sparsity by carefully selecting algorithms: sparse LU factorization,
  General Minimal Residual Method (GMRES)
\item Inner solves could also be iterative and in mixed-precision
\item Possible matrix-free implementation
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Goals}

\begin{enumerate}[{GS}1]
\item Given some matrix \(\matr{A}\) and column vector \(\vec{b}\), the solver
  should iteratively find \(\vec{x}\) satisfying the equation \(\matr{A}\vec{x}
  = \vec{b}\) until the norm of the residual \(\vec{r} = \matr{A}\vec{x} -
  \vec{b}\) is smaller than some tolerance \(\epsilon\), or the maximum number
  of iterations \(n_\mathrm{iter}\) is exhausted, whichever comes first.
\item Given some combinations of floating point precision configuration, the solver
  should perform internal steps such as matrix factorizations, triangular
  solves, and residual computation in these configured precisions.
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Goals (Non-functional)}

\begin{enumerate}[{GS}1]
  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item The solver should offer a quantifiable performance or resource utilization
  advantage over other competing sparse linear solvers.
\item The library should offer a set of streamlined public application
  programming interfaces (APIs), such that when integrated into other software
  as a dependent library, the interfaces are self-contained, readable and easy
  to consume.
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Stretch Goals}

\begin{enumerate}[{GS}1]
  \setcounter{enumi}{4}
\item With the existing solver implementation being the baseline, the refactored
  solver should produce more accurate results, lowering the norm of the residual
  by at least 1 order of magnitude.
\item The solver should optimize existing algorithms such that given the same set
  of inputs, it produces results with the same accuracy in notably less time.
