This work presents the design and implementation of a mixed-precision iterative
refinement (IR) solver for large sparse linear systems, combining fine-grained
parallel incomplete LU (ILU) preconditioning with GMRES. The solver is
implemented in modern C++ with extensive use of templates and concepts to
enforce precision hierarchies, providing flexibility to employ IEEE 754 and
extended floating-point formats. To support extended precision, functionality
was added to the QD library. A modular BLAS-like kernel layer decouples
low-level operations from solver logic, enabling mixed-precision operations
across factorization, Krylov iterations, and residual computations.

Experimental evaluation across a set of sparse matrices highlights the accuracy
and performance trade-offs of mixed-precision configurations. Results show that
increasing factorization precision accelerates convergence, while higher
residual precision stabilizes residual computation without significantly
reducing iteration counts. However, the overall performance is dominated by the
GMRES solve phase, limiting the observed gains from reduced-precision
factorization. The study concludes that while mixed-precision arithmetic offers
potential runtime advantages, the benefits in the current GMRES-IR pipeline
remain modest.
